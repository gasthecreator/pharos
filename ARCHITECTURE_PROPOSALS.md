# Architecture Proposals

**This file is for Gemini (Antigravity).** If building Pharos surfaces a reason to
deviate from, extend, or reconsider anything recorded in `PLAN.md`, write the
proposal here — as a new entry at the top — instead of editing `PLAN.md` directly.

Do not implement the change yet. Wait for Gideon to bring this file to Claude Code
for review. Claude will either:
- **Approve** — fold the decision into `PLAN.md` itself and mark the entry
  `Resolved: Approved` here, or
- **Reject** — leave `PLAN.md` untouched and mark the entry `Resolved: Rejected`
  here, with reasoning.

Only after an entry is marked `Resolved: Approved` should it be implemented.

## How to write a proposal

Copy this template for each new entry:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Short title of the proposed change

**Status:** Pending

**What in PLAN.md this touches:** (section number(s), e.g. "§2.2 Exactly-once
processing semantics")

**What I'm proposing:** (the concrete change — be specific: new component,
different technology, a changed guarantee, etc.)

**Why:** (what you ran into while building that makes the current plan
insufficient, wrong, or worth reconsidering — cite the actual blocker, not just
a preference)

**Alternatives considered:** (what else you looked at and why this is better)

**Impact if approved:** (what else in PLAN.md or already-built code would need
to change)
```
